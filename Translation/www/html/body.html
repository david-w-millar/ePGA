ePGA: Purpose and Use
</h2>
<hr>
<h4 style = "color:red;">
ePGA TRANSLATION SERVICE IS SOLELY FOR RESEARCH,<br>
DEMONSTRATIONAL & EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES <br><br>
ePGA Translation Service is meant to DEMONSTRATE the <u>potential</u> of translating validated PGx knowledge into clinical practice<br><br>
In its current implementation ePGA Translation Service use just public-domain and completely anonymous genotype profiles<br>
from the 1000 Genomes project (Phase I/1092 sample cases, Phase III / 2504 sample cases) in order to <u>demonstrate</u> its functionality<br>
</h4>
<hr>

<h4 style ="text-align:justify; color:blue;">
<ul>
  <li>The ePGA Translation Service adheres to the emerging trend of pre-emptive high-throughput genotyping as a vital clinical (diagnostic and prognostic) decision making component
  aiming to offer respective genotype-to-phenotype inference services as a mean to translate PGx knowledge from bench-to-bedside.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The ePGA Translation Service is based on ‘matching’ individual genotype (SNP) profiles with PGx gene haplotypes, and the subsequent inference of the corresponding metabolizer
  phenotypes. Currently ePGA/Translation component employs harmonized haplotypes-tables as registered and curated by <u><a href="http://www.pharmgkb.org" target="_blank">PharmGKB</a></u> (the most advanced PGx knowledge base).The developers of ePGA are planning to expand the system in order to capture and cover PGx knowledge from other sources as well.<br>
  </li>
  <li>ePGA developers reserve the right at any time, to make changes to the whole or any part of the services offered on this Web-site as it deems appropriate.<br>
  </li>
